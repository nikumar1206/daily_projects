**Elaborative Interrogation**:
- end of JS module, take questions on the day's project

# Discussion Topics: 

- Go over `$l.ajax` and compare it with `$.ajax`: The $l one doesn't return a promise.
- Go over `DomNodeCollection.prototype.on`: We have to store callbacks somewhere because `removeEventListener` needs the callback.
- Go over the logic for document ready callback.

- Tomorrow is the first day of React!
  + stay focused and motivated, it's both the most difficult and the most rewarding module
