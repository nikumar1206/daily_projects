### Elaborative Interrogations: 
- What is the difference between a functional and a class component? 
- What causes a component re-render? 
- Where do props come from? 
- What is internal state? When might you use it?
- What is the difference between export default and export const? What do their imports look like? When might you use them? 
- What is the context in different placesâ€”inside the constructor, inside of the render, inside of the onClick callback? 
- What is a components lifecycle? Name a lifecycle method? Why do we use them?


### Additional things 
- Go through how tabs work.
  - There are a bunch of debuggers. Explain the order in which we hit the debuggers, both when we load up the app and when we switch tabs.
  - There's a debugger before we set state, one after, and one as a callback to `setState`. Explain to them that `setState` is async and that the callback gets invoked after the state has been set and the component has re-rendered.
  - Emphasize that we only hit the debugger in the constructor once!
- Take off the `key` prop in `tabs.jsx:13` and show them the console warning. Emphasize that we _always_ need to _immediately_ fix that warning. React uses the `key` prop for the virtual DOM and there can be really odd behavior if we don't have a `key` prop.
