**w10d5**

- This flextime should be primarily focused on setting up students for a successful weekend.
- Students will have access to the practice assessment after 6pm. It can be found under W11D2 in the curriculum. They have ALMOST everything they need to know to take it, except for React Router (similar to how we distributed JS1 before they knew about inheritance or currying)
- There are also video walkthroughs under W11D2. The password for these videos is `go_video_go` Make sure that students know that password.
- Advice for the weekend:
  - Re-do widgets on your own from the beginning.
  - Re-do Todos on your own from the beginning
  - Watch the practice assessment videos
  - Take the practice assessment AT LEAST once, preferably more
  - Come to office hours (12-4 on Saturday)

- After doling out this advice, spend remaining time taking general questions on react, redux, thunk, etc.
- End at 5:13 to re-join the main room for full-stack lecture
