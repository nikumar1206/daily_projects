# W11D2 - Todos Part 1

**Elaborative Interrogation Questions**

- What are the motivations for redux?  

- Describe the `store` object returned from reduxâ€™s `createStore`. (Looking for getState, dispatch, subscribe, and the fact that it contains the state but only allows us to read from it using getState and write to it using dispatch)

- What does Provider do for us and why is it necessary? 

- What is the distinction between a presentational and a container component? 

- In an app with connected components, describe what occurs when we dispatch an action. (Because this answer involves a relatively long series of steps, potentially worth stopping the first student answering this halfway through and having another student pick up the second half)

- How do msp and mdp provide props to our presentational components? (Describe the function of `connect`) 

- How does combineReducers work / what is the responsibility of our rootReducer? 

- Why is it important that our reducers be pure functions?
