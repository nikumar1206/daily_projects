# W11D4 

- The last boozy Circle Time is here! 
- Talk about React-1 Assessment/A06, full-stacks, and any questions on BenchBnB

Here are some questions to get started:
- If you could change only one thing about JS, what would it be?
- What was the most difficult challenge you experienced this week?
- What was your greatest achievement this week?
- Who's excited for their Full Stack Project? (Ha!)
- What tools or tricks do you generally use to manage your time? - Let's talk about building feature-by-feature and zig-zagging through the full stack here. !important (their timeline should reflect this) - Agile (iterate and s
hip working features quickly) - Will always have a working app (albeit minimal) - Remind them that final proposals are due on Monday and they can expect full feedback then.
- React-1 assessment/A06 is basically a condensed version of working through a feature of your full stack (minus styling) so studying will be some of the best preparation you can do!
- Go through the practice assessment at least 4 times over the weekend.
