# W11D5

- The last Circle Time is here! 
- Talk about React-1 Assessment/A06, full-stacks, and any questions on [BenchBnB](w11d4/))

## Announcements

- React-1 assessment/A06 is basically a condensed version of working through a feature of your full stack (minus styling) so studying will be some of the best preparation you can do!

- If you do not get a perfect score on the assessment on Monday, you'll need to complete corrections before beginning your full stack. 
  
- Go through the practice assessment at least 4 times over the weekend

- Fullstacks will be built feature by feature (including CSS!)
  - CSS always takes more time than students realize
  - Students' MVP list timeline should reflect working in slices (feature by feature)
  - this workflow (Agile) ensures that there is always a working app at any time

- Make sure each student knows their PM's preferred workflow for code reviews, e.g.:
  1. Student completes feature and opens issue on GitHub
  2. PM reviews completed feature and leaves comments/tasks
  3. Student completes tasks, closes the issue
  4. Repeat for each feature

- Make sure each student knows how to ask good questions (basically a Stack Overflow post)
  1. Put questions in circle channel rather than DMs
  2. Include code snippets (w/ line numbers!)
  3. Include the ***full*** error message(s)
  4. Provide context on what you think caused the error and what you've done to debug
