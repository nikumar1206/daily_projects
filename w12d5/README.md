**Our last circle time!**

**FUN**

- What's the most interesting thing you discovered or learned while
  studying the app you're cloning? Any weird features? Or unexpected
  behavior? Or fun design quirks?

**SETTING UP FOR PRODUCTIVE WEEKEND**

- This weekend they are expected to work the same amount of time and intensity as during the week.
- They will not have access to TAs, but they _will_ have:
  - Each other! (Zoom room will be open all weekend, use it!)
  - AAOnline (lots of resources in the fullstack tab)
  - Documentation (React and Redux docs are GREAT! Rails docs are pretty good)
  - Google/Stack Overflow (make sure to read through a few resources before trying to implement something) 
  - Your debugging skills! (check the console, the server log, your webpack output! use debuggers! read your error messages!)
- If any of your students are planning on setting up AWS this weekend, emphasize that they should be EXTREMELY precise while following the instructions.
- Start keeping a list of big bugs and cool solutions that came up with. This will be invaluable when they start interviewing and want technical anecdotes. 


**FULL STACK PROJECT**

- What was the longest you worked on a single bug or feature?
- How do you manage your time and avoid big time sucks?
- What are you most proud of so far on your project?
- What feature are you most excited to implement the coming week?


**BIGGER PICTURE**

- When did you realize you wanted to be a developer?

**CLOSE**

- Motivation for keeping a log of features and bugs they solve. These
  will be great talking points with potential employers.
