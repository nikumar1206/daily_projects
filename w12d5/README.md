**Our last circle time!**

**FUN**

- What's the most interesting thing you discovered or learned while
  studying the app you're cloning? Any weird features? Or unexpected
  behavior? Or fun design quirks?

**FULL STACK PROJECT**

- What was the longest you worked on a single bug or feature?
- How do you manage your time and avoid big time sucks?
- What are you most proud of so far on your project?
- What feature are you most excited to implement the coming week?

* Let's motivate them to keep a list of big bugs and cool solutions
  that came up with.

**BIGGER PICTURE**

- When did you realize you wanted to be a developer?

**CLOSE**

  will be great talking points with potential employers.
