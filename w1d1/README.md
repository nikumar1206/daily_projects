# W1D1

## Core Concepts

- Using documentation
- Symbols
- Default args/Options hashes
- Splat operator
- Inject
- Ruby scoping
- Bubble sort
- Variable references (2 parts)

## Discussion

Go over any lingering questions about the course, our expectations, or anything that may have come up during lecture or floor time. Remind students of the goals of pairing - we prioritize cooperation and full understanding, *not* progress made through the projects!

Take questions on the projects they worked on today once everyone's clear on course expectations. Make sure to show the docs if anyone is unclear about how a particular method works, and then show an example of it working in Ruby with printing statements as necessary (no debuggers yet).

- `advanced_methods_solution/04_filter_lengths.rb` has the first example of default args
- `advanced_methods_solution/05_max_inject.rb` has the first splat operator and the inject method
- `algorithmic_strategies_solution/03_bubble_sort.rb` has their first sorting algorithm
- The first four problems in `references_exercise_solution` are dangerous methods involving object ids; all involve variable references.
