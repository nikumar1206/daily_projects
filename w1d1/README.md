# W1D1

## Core Concepts

- Using documentation
- Symbols
- Default args/Options hashes
- Splat operator
- Inject
- Ruby scoping
- Bubble sort
- Variable references (2 parts)

## Discussion

Go over any lingering questions about the course, our expectations, or anything that may have come up during lecture or floor time. Remind students of the goals of pairing - we prioritize cooperation and full understanding, *not* progress made through the projects!

Take questions on the projects they worked on today once everyone's clear on course expectations. Make sure to show the docs if anyone is unclear about how a particular method works, and then show an example of it working in Ruby with printing statements as necessary (no debuggers yet).

- `advanced_methods_solution/04_filter_lengths.rb` has the first example of default args
- `advanced_methods_solution/05_max_inject.rb` has the first splat operator and the inject method
- `algorithmic_strategies_solution/03_bubble_sort.rb` has their first sorting algorithm
- The first four problems in `references_exercise_solution` are dangerous methods involving object ids; all involve variable references.

# Announcements:
- Stress that they should be aiming for understanding instead of completion.
    - Students are often sad when they do not finish the project today, assure them that it is fine and it is common.
- Remind students how to ask a question using Progress Tracker. They should not use the zoom question button or slack. 
- Take breaks seriously! Right now everyone is eager to code, but we don't want to let that lead us to burnout.
- Make sure to do the homework. Use the alloted timestamps, no more no less. If you do not finish in the recommended time, move on.
