## Discussion

Students likely did not get very far in nauseating numbers. 

Take questions on anything that the students are curious about but don't spend a lot of time with questions in Phase 3/4 since not everyone got to it. 

Reassure students that the problems in nauseating numbers are challenging and it's okay if people did not get to it/couldn't solve it.
