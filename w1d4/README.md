## Core Concepts

- Debugging

## Discussion

Today's main focus was to get used to RSpec and have some more problems with Procs. 

Take any questions related to the RSpec exercises 
    - Make sure students feel comfortable working with hashes, see `element_count` in `rspec_exercise_3_solution/lib/part_2.rb` as well as `hash_select`in `rspec_exercise_4_solution/lib/part_1.rb`.

Take any questions on Perilous Procs. Remind them that like nauseating numbers, some of the later problems are challening and can take a while to solve. 

Students should not feel discouraged if they were unable to reach a solution for some of these problems. Reassure them that if they were able to understand everything in the RSpec exercies, then they are in great shape for the course.
