## Discussion

Break early to spend as much time as necessary discussing logistics for the first remote assessment.

Since Zoom supports at most 50 breakout rooms, students will split into groups depending on pod so that each can have their own room on the assessment. Students should confirm on Progress Tracker which pod they are in and await a link in the Slack channel on Monday morning. We'll assign each to their own room, where they'll keep their cameras on and screen share their whole desktop. Instructors will routinely move through each room, but if they have questions, students can request help through Zoom (and not through Progress Tracker, since they'll be paired that day).

Students have one hour to finish the test, after which they'll submit via PT and take a short break. We'll all rejoin in the main classroom after and begin the day's assignment.

Students should review RSpec exercises 1-5 as a stand-in for a practice assessment.

Go through as much of today's projects as students like. Also make sure to cover each bullet point on the assessment check-in list.
