## Core Concepts

- Recursion
- Recap
- Spaceship operator
- Nil and truthy vs falsey

## Discussion

Recursion is not on FA2, but it's still worth reviewing, since we'll visit it next week in more depth and it will make an appearance on A01. First, though, it's worth making sure everyone feels good about the more advanced class methods that will be on FA2. 

- `sum_array` is a good problem to focus on recursion basics without distracting students who aren't comfortable with the math in `pow` or `lucas_number`.
- `flatten` has likely been the trickiest thing students handled thus far; it's worth spending as much time as necessary, with debuggers, getting students comfortable with this one. use `flatten2` with debuggers!
- `Array#bubble_sort` in `recap_exercise_2` can be tricky for students - they may have forgotten bubble sort or had difficulty with `Proc#call`.
- `prime_factorization` in `recap_exercise_3` has a few different solutions - show them ours to reacquaint them with the `*` operator, but feel free to explore how this might be done with array concatenation.
