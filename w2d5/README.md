## Discussion

Break early to spend as much time as necessary discussing logistics for the second remote assessment.

As before, students should know their current pods and wait for a link to the correct room on Monday morning. Emphasize that this assessment is designed to be a challenge; they should feel very comfortable with everything we've done so far in object-oriented programming in order to do well on the assessment. They won't be tested on recursion, but we'll explore recursion in even more depth next week when the full-time course begins, so it would behoove them to study that this weekend as well.

Follow any student questions from material this week, making sure to emphasize how to read what you're supposed to do from the spec file (since that will be the only instruction they get on Monday).

- `Array#bubble_sort` in `recap_exercise_2` can be tricky for students - they may have forgotten bubble sort or had difficulty with `Proc#call`.
- `prime_factorization` in `recap_exercise_3` has a few different solutions - show them ours to reacquaint them with the `*` operator, but feel free to explore how this might be done with array concatenation.
