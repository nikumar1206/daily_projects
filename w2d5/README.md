## Discussion

Break early to spend as much time as necessary discussing logistics for the second remote assessment.

As before, students should know their current pods and wait for a link to the correct room on Monday morning. Emphasize that this assessment is designed to be a challenge; they should feel very comfortable with everything we've done so far in object-oriented programming in order to do well on the assessment. They won't be tested on recursion, but we'll explore recursion in even more depth next week when the full-time course begins, so it would behoove them to study that this weekend as well.

Follow any student questions from material this week, making sure to emphasize how to read what you're supposed to do from the spec file (since that will be the only instruction they get on Monday). Students should be referencing the FA2 study guide often. 

Students should study Battleship, Mastermind, and Tic Tac Toe (v1) over the weekend. Should feel comfortable with making grids and working with them. 

- Take any questions on `Flight Project` and `Todo Board`. 
- Take a look at the `print` function in `list.rb`. Many terminal games will often have a print method
