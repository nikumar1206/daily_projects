### Anagrams

- Be able to determine the time and space complexity of a method
- Be able to recognize when and how time or space complexity can be improved
- Be able to compare different methods and discuss how changing inputs affects each one's overall runtime

### Two Sum Problem

- Be able to recognize when time or space complexity can be improved
- Know some common tricks to improve time or space complexity

## Discussion

Bring student attention to the Assessment Two Study Guide under W4D1 - all these points should be familiar to them at this point, and Monday's assessment may ask them to explain any of these concepts. There are prep resources under W5D1, including video walkthroughs to get them used to the logistics of the assessment, which they should spend plenty of time this weekend reviewing. They may ask for resources they can drill - emphasize that this assessment prioritizes an understanding of the concepts at play, so they should go over their notes, flashcards, and old homework projects and readings.

- Talk through the second `largest_contiguous_subsum`. Most people will have called us over for this, but it can't hurt to go over it again.
- Talk about why `fourth_anagram?` is constant space. Again, most people will already have heard an explanation, but ask them if they want to hear the explanation again.
- Many people won't have gotten to the max windowed range project. But they could still benefit from getting introduced to stack queues, so talk through that.
