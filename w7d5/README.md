# Week 7, Day 5

## Learning Goals
- Be able to reason about styling approaches from screenshots of a design
- Be able to layout elements in a custom Grid system
- Know how to create interactive elements such as sidebars and dropdowns
- Understand media queries and responsive design
- Know how to use an icon font system
- Know how to organize stylesheets in a Rails Application

## CSS Review

Take general questions on AA_Times. 

No need to spend too much time here since they should have asked plenty of questions during the two days. 

Consider reviewing these topics:
- The Box Model: Padding, border, margin
- Different `display` properties. Specifically block, inline, inline-block and flex. 
- Talk about the `position` property, specifically `relative` vs `absolute`.

Some of them will still hate CSS after today. Tell them that styling is important: recruiters are more likely to take a closer look at their full-stack projects if they look good.

## Rails 2 Prep

- Take any questions on Rails 2 practice assessment. 
- Remind them about the walkthrough on Monday and encourage them to write down questions over the weekend so they can come prepared to that.
- One tip (that will help mitigate a small bug in the practice assessment) is that they do NOT need to write an database validations in their migrations. Talking about the bug itself will likely lead to confusion, so simply present it as a time-saving strategy. 
- If there aren't enough questions to fill time, quiz them on general rails/auth concepts (what is an MVC framework? how do we use session tokens to determine the current user? what is csrf and how do we prevent it? etc etc). 
- Go over general test taking advice again and encourage them to come to office hours!
