# W8D2

- Call circle time at 5:15-5:30 and let students go at early as a break after a long exam and project.
- No need to cover Rails Lite today. People are still going to be thinking about the assessment and will most likely be exhausted.
- Students may have lost members of the circle or members of the cohort after Rails 2. Open the floor up to anything they wish to talk about in the beginning. Feel free to spend as long as necessary addressing their concerns.
- At the end, remind students that JavaScript is the next unit, and we should be excited to explore the language of the modern web. Poll for everyone's favorite parts of Ruby and Rails, and remind them we'll come back to the skills we've been learning soon.
