# Circle time: 
- First in person circle time! Ask them the usual circle time questions: 
    - What's your greatest achievement of the week?
    - What was your biggest struggle this week?
- Talk about next week and get them motivated:
    - You've almost made it! So close to having full-stack super powers! Next week we're diving into React+Redux.
    - It will be the hardest, but most rewarding week of the course. It will be the most overwhelming time so far, so expect to feel like you're barely staying above water (or not even).
    - Next week will be VERY stressful, but then do your best! (really, actually your best- don't use this as a cop-out i.e. "well, I did my best...").
    - Directly after this, we're going into Full Stack Projects which will give us 2 weeks+ to solidify all of the learning of this next week.
    - The FSP is one of the main portfolio pieces when we apply to jobs, so how well we do in the job search will be directly influenced by the quality of the FSP, which is directly influenced by the effort we put in next week.
- Ask if anyone want's to share effective study habits that they have developed for the course! 

# Discussion Topics: 

- Go over `$l.ajax` and compare it with `$.ajax`: The $l one doesn't return a promise.
- Go over `DomNodeCollection.prototype.on`: We have to store callbacks somewhere because `removeEventListener` needs the callback.
- Go over the logic for document ready callback.
